# Blip

Instantly get the item you need.

## About

Blip is a Fabric mod that allows you to quickly put any item in your hand.

Here's how it works:

The search is activated by a configurable keybind (default J), which activates a text box. When you type into the text
box, Blip uses your query to search for items. When you press Enter (or return, on Mac), the top result in placed in your
hand. You will be given a single item if in Creative mode. If in Survival mode, the first stack will be moved into
your hand, and whatever was in your hand will move to where the selected item stack was.

You may optionally specify a number before or after the query separated by a space to specify the number of items to put
in your hand. For example, the queries **carr 16** or **16 carr** would give you 16 carrots.
